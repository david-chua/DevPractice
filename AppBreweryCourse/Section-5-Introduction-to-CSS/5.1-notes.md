# Why do we need CSS?

Developers wanted to style their website. 

## Initial design applications
HTML used to have specific tags to change how the website should look like

- Fonts
- Colors
- Face
- Size
- Center

Initial application made it difficult to find the difference between what is styling and what is content. 

## CSS - Cascading Style Sheets 
Created by Hakon Wium Lie and Bert Bos 
This allowed a simple style sheet mechanism that allows developers to attach styles such as fonts, colors, etc

This breakthrough allowed developers to differentiate from content and styling --> Allowing for separation of concern.
