## Element Selector:
- Applies to elements that have the specific tag

```
    <h2>Red</h2>
    <h2>Green</h2>
    <h2>Blue</h2>
```
Styling:

```
h2{
    color: red;
}
```

- This styling will cause all the h2 text abot to turn red as it applies to all the h2 tags. 

## Class selector:
- Selector that applies to classes

```
.red-heading{
    color: red;
}
```

- Class are attributes that can be added inside an html tag
- <h2 class="red-text">Red</h2>

```
.red-text{
    color: red;
}
```

## ID selector
- There should only be 1 ID selector per html page. 
- It should be completely unique
- Classes are for many elements vs IDs are for one element per file. 

## Attribute Selector
```
 p[draggable]{
    color: red;
 }
 ```

 HTML code:
 ```
 <p draggable="true">Drag me</p>
 <p> Don't drag me</p>
 <p> Don't drag me</p>
```

Can also do:

```
 p[draggable="false"]{
    color: red;
 }
 ```

HTML:

```
<p draggable="true">Drag me</p>
<p draggable="false"> Don't drag me</p>
<p draggable="false"> Don't drag me</p>
```
