# How to Add CSS

3 ways to add CSS into an HTML website
- inline
- internal
- external 


## Inline 
- Adding style="" inside HTML tags. 
- ie: style="background:blue" 
- background is the property 
- blue is the value 
- in line is cumbersome as there's a lot of HTML elements and if you want to add the same styles in more than 1 element that needs the styling, you'll need to add the inline style in each tag. 

## Internal CSS
- Adding style tag in HTML element 

```
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            html{
                background: red; 
            }
        </style>
    </head>
</html>
```

- Useful only for single page HTML. Multiple pages will need to copy and paste styles that is needed for the other pages. 

## External CSS
- Most commonly used css styling 
- While this is the most common, it's important to know about all the styling methods as this will be encountered in different companies, settings.
