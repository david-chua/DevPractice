### What is HTML?

HTML is one of the languages we used for web development. It stands for **HyperText Markup Language**

HTML is what we call a markup language as opposed to a programming language. This means that this is specficially designed to display data rather than execute tasks.

### What are tags?

Tags are names built into the language and must be written exactly as expected in order for our HTML to render properly. paragraph is not a valid HTML tag name but p is.

*<p>

p is the paragraph element. It is meant for holding text. By default, it willl render text to the screen on a new line.

*<div>

div element is a generic container. It is used primarily for grouping other HTML elements together. It is invisible by default and usually used for positioning or styling a group of elements.

It is a block element by default and will take its own, full line.

*<span>

A span element is a generic container. It does not create a new line like <p> element. It is usually used for styling words or phrases within a larger body of text.

*<h1> - <h6>

The header tags are intended to be used in a way to present subject matter of a page. The most important, h1, is the largest and decreases in size as you go down to h6.

There should only be 1 h1 tag per page. This will not cause an error but is seen as a best practice as it's reserved for the most important heading in the page.

#### Additional elements

*<a> tag

The anchor element is used to create links to other web pages or even areas within our own web page.

*<img> tag

This element will display an image on the screen.
It will always have an 'src' attribute which points to the address of the image displayed.

NOTE: img tags can be self closing as they do not need to tags.

*<ul> and <ol>

These elements represents unorder or ordered list.
ul is for unordered, Something like a grocery list
ol is for ordered, something like a set of instructions that need to be followed step by step.
