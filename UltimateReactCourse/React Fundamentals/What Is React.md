## What is React?
- Extremely popular declarative, component based state-driven Javascript library for building user interfaces, created by Facebook

1. Based on Components 
- Components are the building blocks of user interfaces in React
- Take components and draw them on a web page
- We build complext UIs by building and combining them in web pages. 

2. Declarative
- We describe how components look like and how they work using a declarative syntax called JSX
- Declarative - Telling React what a component should look like, based on current data/state
- React is abstraction away from DOM: We never touch the DOM
- JSX: a syntax that combined HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as referencing other components 

3. State-driven 
 State --> Render a UI interface written in JSX> 
 Based on events such as adding more data 
 State changes --> React will automatically re-render the UI with state changes 
 - React reacts to state changes by re-rendering UI

 4. JavaScript Library
 - Is React a library or a framework?
 - Because React is only the "view" layer. We need to pick multiple external libraries to build a complete applications. 
 - There are complete frameworks built on top of React (Next.js and Remix are examples)

 5. Extremely Popular 
 - React is by far, the most used framework/library. 
 - A reason is that a lot of companies have adopted React a long time ago
 - Huge job market with high demand for React developers
 - Large and vibrant React developer community 

 6. React was created by Facebook 
 - Created by Jordan Walke, an engineer working at Facebook at the time 
 - Backed by Facebook/Meta
 - In 2013, React was open sourced which completely transformed front-end Web Development. 
 - Modern frameworks were created as a response 

 ## Summary
 
 1. Rendering components on a webpage (UI) based on their current state.
 2. Keeping the UI in sync with state, by re-rendering (reacting) when state changes
